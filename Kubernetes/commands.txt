We installed kubernetes

We start a cluster by:
    minikube start --driver=docker

We install kubectl by:
    minikube kubectl -- get po -A

We can view the dashboard by:
    minikube dashboard

We can create a webserver by:
    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.39 -- /agnhost netexec --http-port=8080

Then we can view the deployment by:
    kubectl get deployments

We can view the pods by:
    kubectl get pods

We can view cluster events:
    kubectl get events

We can view the logs from a container where NAME is the name of the desired note
from kubectl get pods:
    kubectl logs NAME

We can expose a pod to the public internet using
    kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080

We can view our services by:
    kubectl get services

To open up a browser window that serves my app do:
    minikube service hello-node

Currently supported addons can be shown by:
    minikube addons list

One can enable addons with:
    minikube addons enable metrics-server

We can view the pod and service we created by installing that addon:
    kubectl get pod,svc -n kube-system

We can get output from the metrics-server:
    kubectl top pods

We can disable an addon by:
    minikube addons disable metrics-server

We can delete a service by:
    kubectl delete service hello-node
    kubectl delete deployment hello-node

We can stop or delete the cluster by:
    minikube stop
    minikube delete

We can access our pod where POD_NAME can be found by the get pods command:
    curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/$POD_NAME:8080/proxy/

We can execute a command on a container in a pod with:
    kubectl exec

We can get a bash by:
    kubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME -- bash

To show the app in the terminal:
    kubectl proxy

We can get the output from an exposed app by:
    export NODE_PORT="$(kubectl get services/kubernetes-bootcamp -o go-template='{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')"
    curl http://"$(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT"

We can scale the deployment by:
    kubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp --replicas=4
