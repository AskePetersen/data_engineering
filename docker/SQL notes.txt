This is notes on SQL:
READ UP ON:
    Joins, Inner Join, Outer Join, Left Join, Right Join

GROUP BY:
    If multiple events happen on the same days, one can use group by to count
    the amount of occurences on each day.
    
COUNT:
    Count the number of occurrences of what we query

ORDER BY:
    Can be used to order dates or counts 

CAST:
    I believe is used to cast datatypes
