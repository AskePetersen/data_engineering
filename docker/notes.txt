Pay attention to:
    you dont use -it in the docker run command, probably because we use git bash
    host is pgdatabase
    In the run script we use port 5432
    You might have to change the network. It's typically called the same as your
        folder. run 'docker network ls' to get the available networks
    Remember to be connected to the network.
    pgadmin is at localhost:8080
    There are multiple connection between the 'docker run' and 'docker-compose.yaml'
        script.

To close docker:
    docker-compose down -- You have to be in the correct folder
