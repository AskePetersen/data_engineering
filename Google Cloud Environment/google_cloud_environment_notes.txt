We learn to use compute engine on google cloud.
We can create a ssh key by 
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/gcp_key -C aske

We create a VM instance
    we chose ubuntu with 30 GB

We ssh to the machine by:
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/gcp_key aske@34.141.83.28

We want anaconda:
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh

We edit our local config to gcp s.t. we can just type ssh gcp in the terminal:
    ssh gcp

We can edit on the machine with vim by:
    vim scp://gcp//home/aske/

We git clone the course git

We install docker, initially root access is required but we find a work around

We install docker-compose

we navigate to the dockerfolder in the github and run 
    docker-compose up -d

we want pip install pgcli:

We can map the port to our local machine:
    through vs code
    we do 5432 and 8080 and 8888
    postgres is on 5432 
    and pgadmin on 8080 
    jupyter notebook on 8888

We create a database like with docker on our local machine and copy the
    google credentials with sftp

We export the google credentials variable:
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/keys/my-creds.json

And then we can do:
    gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

And then we just setup terraform with google up as we did locally
    terraform init, plan, apply, destroy

We can stop the VM such that we don't get charged by google
    sudo shutdown now 

But we can start it again if we want to from the google site
