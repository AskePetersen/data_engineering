## About this project
    Every folder here contains what I've learned from the data engineering zoomcamp 
    and code from my advent of code projects. Advent of code is a coding competition 
    that runs through all of december and tests your problem solving skills on multiple 
    parameters like problem analysis, code efficiency and knowledge of algorithms and 
    data structures.
