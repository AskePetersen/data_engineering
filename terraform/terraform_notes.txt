Terraform_notes:

To make a bucket we gave a service 
    cloud storage -> storage admin rights
    bigquery admin


Do terraform init to get the provider

With the current files we can do <<terraform plan>> to view the actions that
    terraform will take. This is a good idea in order to be sure what it will
    do. We do <<terraform apply>> when we are ready to deploy to gcp

variables.tf is used to set up our dataset by defining variables we can use in
    main.tf
main.tf is used to define how we connect with the google cloud platform

In terraform I've learned to setup a dataset in gcp using terraform, how to use
variables and set main.tf as well as handling credentials in a responsible
matter
