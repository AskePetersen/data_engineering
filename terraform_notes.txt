Terraform_notes:

To make a bucket we gave a service 
    cloud storage -> storage admin rights
    bigquery admin


Do terraform init to get the provider

With the current files we can do terraform plan to view the actions that
    terraform will take. This is a good idea in order to be sure what it will
    do.
